/**
 * Creates a fullscreen triangle geometry for post-processing passes.
 *
 * Uses an oversized triangle technique for efficiency (3 vertices instead of 6).
 * The triangle covers clip space from (-1,-1) to (3,-1) to (-1,3), ensuring
 * full viewport coverage after clipping.
 *
 * UV coordinates follow WebGPU conventions:
 *   - (0, 0) at top-left of texture
 *   - (1, 1) at bottom-right of texture
 *
 * Since clip space Y=-1 is bottom and Y=+1 is top, but texture V=0 is top and V=1 is bottom,
 * we map: bottom-left clip (-1,-1) → UV (0,1), top-left clip (-1,3) → UV (0,-1).
 *
 * @param flipY - Whether to flip UV coordinates along the vertical axis. Defaults to false.
